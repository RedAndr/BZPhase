Program for Modeling and Building of 4D Phase Portraits of Belousov-Zhaboibsky reaction

The program BZPhase is intended for modeling of famous Belousov-Zhabotinsky
reaction and 4D phase portraits construction, in accordance with the model
based on the detailed eleven-stage scheme (Table 1 in Supl. 1) with some
modification: four variables had been included in rate constants.

The given reaction scheme show a variety of dynamics: from simple quasisinusoidal
oscillations to quasiperiodic, bursting, complex periodic and various chaotic ones
in following alternation order:
SS - QS - QP - B - CP - B - QP - QS - SS
where
*  SS = stationary state
*  QS = quasisinusoidal oscillations of low amplitude
*  QP = quasiperiodic regimes
*  B  = bursting oscillations
*  CP = a complex succession of chaotic and periodic regimes
